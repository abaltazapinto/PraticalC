Purpose : Learning about the use of modulus.

	the modulus operator in C just workk with integers, long , etc) not floating point numbers (float or double).

	How to fix that?

	> Since you are working with money, which likely involves decimals, you can use gmod function from <math.h> instead of %.

	Example:

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <math.h>

	int main()
	{
		float money = 20.5;

		if (fmod(money, 10) == 0)
			printf("The value is a multiple of 10. \n);

		return 0;
}


Now i discoved another issue. 

with scanf im not abkle to scan the float. 

i need another way to do the same thing. 


another trick that i learned is the problems of using flloating points , then we need to convert first to ints.

to convert 

cents = (int)(money * 100 + 0.5) //adding the 0.5 to handle rounding properly
